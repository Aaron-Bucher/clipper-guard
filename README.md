# Parametric Clipper Guards (Grasshopper)

This repository contains two Grasshopper scripts for generating custom 3D-printable clipper guards.  
The definitions are designed for two specific hair clippers:

- **Philips Series 5000**
- **Panasonic Beard Trimmer ER-GB62**

Both scripts allow you to parametrize and customize the clipper guard geometry before exporting for 3D printing.

## ✨ Features
- Fully parametric Grasshopper definitions
- Adjustable dimensions for personalized fit
- Ready for 3D printing (e.g. STL export from Rhino)
- Designed for:
  - Philips Series 5000
  - Panasonic ER-GB62

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Rhino 7 (or later)** with Grasshopper
- Basic knowledge of Grasshopper

### Usage
1. Open the `.gh` file in Grasshopper.
2. Adjust parameters (guard length, thickness, etc.) as needed.
3. Bake the geometry into Rhino.
4. Export the baked geometry as `.stl` or `.obj` for 3D printing.
